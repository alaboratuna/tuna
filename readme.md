        Who the hell ru?
 My real name is Tuna and I am a high school student studying IT. I love open source projects and I choose open source as much as possible, well, that's why I hate Apple (I probably didn't need to say that, but... okay!). I aim to make a lot of customizable things on the terminal and if I survive in Turkey, I will probably become a cyber security expert.
  
      Do you think we can stay 100% safe and anonymous on the internet?
 No. You can't. The Internet is something that has existed for years, you may have posted your photo somewhere, you may have left a mark and you may not be aware of it. Maybe you can be anonymous using some apps and maybe you can hide your IP adress (like VPN). But other than that, there's probably a crippled pervert who could e-mail your information and ruin your life.
 
      What do you think about LGBTQ+?
      
I'm heterosexual, but I don't give a fuck about people's sexual opinions.
