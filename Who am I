        Who the hell ru?
  My name is Tuna, I am a student of the faculty of political sciences (actually i'm not a student yet, i'm still a high school student) but I also develop applications for cybersecurity professionals in my spare time. I will never take this job seriously and never intend to become a cybersecurity worker because I don't want it to be my real job. 
  
      Do you think we can stay 100% safe and anonymous on the internet?
 No. You can't. The Internet is something that has existed for years, you may have posted your photo somewhere, you may have left a mark and you may not be aware of it. Maybe you can be anonymous using some apps (like VPN). But other than that, there's probably a crippled pervert who could e-mail your information and ruin your life.
 
      What do you think about LGBTQ+?
      
I'm not gay, but I don't give a f##k because people's opinions are like that and it doesn't hurt me either.
